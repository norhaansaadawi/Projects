#About Me

Hello, I'm Norhaan Saadawi!

Welcome to my personal portfolio! I’m a Data Science Master's graduate from Coventry University and an alumnus of Carleton University (BSc in Health Sciences, Minor in Statistics). With a strong background in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization, I have worked on projects involving predictive modeling, time series forecasting, and addressing healthcare challenges. My experience spans:

1. Data Analytics & Visualization – Exploring trends and insights using Python, R, and Tableau
2. Machine Learning & AI – Building models for classification, regression, and forecasting tasks
3. Health & Biomedical Data Science – Applying data science to healthcare and public health challenges
4. Hackathons & Data Challenges – Participating in competitive data science challenges to solve real-world problems
   
In this repository, you’ll find a collection of my projects from academics, hackathons, and personal interests. If you want to learn more feel free to connect!
